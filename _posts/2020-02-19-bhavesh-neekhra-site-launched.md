Well. I have been thinking for a long time to create my website on github. I got a push from my department as they requested my
information to put University website. I thought why not create the site now.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

The tutorial I followed to create this site: (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
